- 🚀 Features
1. 🔍 Word Search
The app allows users to search for any word and retrieve its definition.
It displays word meanings, pronunciation, and any associated examples or synonyms.
2. 🌙 Dark Mode / ☀️ Light Mode
Users can switch between dark and light modes to adjust the theme of the web app.
The theme preference is stored, so the app remembers the user's choice.
3. ✍️ Change Font
Users can change the font of the dictionary for better readability.
Multiple font options are available to cater to user preferences.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5 for the structure of the web app.
- CSS3 for styling, including the implementation of the dark/light mode feature.
- JavaScript for handling the search functionality, mode toggling, and font changes.
- TypeScript (after the two-month update) to provide type safety and improve maintainability.

# 🧑‍💻 How to Use
- Search for a Word: Use the search bar to find definitions, pronunciations, and other details about a word.
- Switch Theme: Toggle between dark and light mode using the mode switch button.
- Change Font: Select your preferred font style from the available options to customize the appearance.

# 🛠️ Two-Month Update: TypeScript Conversion
After learning TypeScript, I updated this project to take advantage of TypeScript's type safety features. Key areas of the project now use TypeScript for better error checking and maintainability. Some of the improvements include:

- Improved Search Functionality: Refined the search function to handle different edge cases and added explicit types for the API responses.
- Theme and Font Switching: Refactored the dark/light mode and font change features with type-safe event handling.
- Better Error Handling: TypeScript now ensures that all potential edge cases are handled, making the app more robust.

# 🎯 Challenges and Learning Outcomes
- API Integration: Learning how to work with dictionary APIs and managing different types of responses.
- Dark Mode: Implementing smooth transitions between dark and light modes while ensuring the design remains accessible.
- TypeScript: The update to TypeScript allowed me to improve the overall reliability of the code, reduce runtime errors, and refactor code for better scalability.
- Font Customization: Giving users a choice of fonts added an extra layer of personalization to the app, enhancing the user experience.
